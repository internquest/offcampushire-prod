              When it comes to placement drives, many companies have
              traditionally required students to meet certain CGPA requirements
              in order to be eligible to apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recognize that your true potential goes beyond a GPA and so
              we&apos;re breaking down barriers of CGPA requirements, redefining
              the eligibility criteria for freshers to participate in off-campus
              drives based on skills, passion, and commitment, irrespective of
              academic grades.
